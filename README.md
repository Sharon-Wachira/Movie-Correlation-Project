# Movie-Correlation-Project
This project explores the relationship between different factors that contribute to a movie's financial success. Using a dataset of movies, I cleaned the data, performed some exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis to identify the variables that impact the gross earning of the movies. 


#### Key Objectives of this Project
Cleaning and processing the dataset. 
Analysing the correlation between the variables such as budget, revenue, IMDb ratings and year of release
Using both Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the key relationships.
Gain insights on what factors contribute to the success of a movie. 

#### Correlation Between Features
The heatmap showcases correlation between various numerical features where darker shades show weaker correlations and lighter shades evidence stronger correlations.

##### Key Observations

Budget vs. Gross Revenue (0.76): Strong positive correlation. Higher budgets typically result in higher earnings.

Votes vs. Gross Revenue (0.63): More votes suggest higher audience engagement, leading to better financial success.

Score vs. Gross Revenue (0.19): Weak correlationâ€”high IMDb scores alone do not guarantee high box office revenue.

Budget vs. Votes (0.48): Bigger budgets likely allow for better marketing, leading to more audience votes.

#### Business Insights from the Analysis and Reccommendations.

2. More votes from the audience are linked to higher earnings.
3. Movie length doesnt necessarilLy mean higher revenue.
5. Newer movies trend to have bigger budgets. 

##### Recommendations
Studios need to invest more in high-production quality, marketing and top-tier talent to maximize returns. However, spending should be data-driven. By analysing the historical performance, the optimal budget for specific genres can be identified. 

Studios should encourage ratings from the audience through ratings, social media discussions and fan-driven marketing campaigns. providing hype before a movie release and influencer marketing can drive higher audience participation and boost ticket sales in cases of movie screening. 

Genre and Storytelling should be the key focus on movies. Longer movie does not necessarily perform better financially. Instead, the studios should prioritize the entertainment value to maximize audience retention and satisfaction. 

Budget plan should also keep inflation and market trends in mind. Since newer movies have bigger budgets, studios and production teams should account for the rise in cost. 

#### Conclusion
By leveraging data-driven decision-making, producers and investors can optimize spending , predict the trends in the market and create movies that resonate with audiences when ensuring a great financial performance. This project is an evidence of how data analytis can provide business insights that can contribute to informed data decision-making in the entertainment industry.
